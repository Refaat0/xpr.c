## About The Project
xpr.c is a command line application that uses a "Read-Eval-Print-Loop" interface to evaluate mathematical expression provided by a user. 

This project was meant to be a gateway to the world of low-level computer programming. I wanted to work on a project that would introduce me to
concepts such as lexical analysis & parsing, and thought that this project would be a great place to start (it was!). This project will be used as
my stepping stone for future low level projects I want to work on, such as other parsers, interpreters, compilers, and languages.
